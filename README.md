## Key Insights & Findings

- The **average female enrollment in STEM** is **43.94%**, with the **United States** having the highest enrollment at **45.72%**, meaning more women in the U.S. enter STEM programs compared to other countries.

- The **average female graduation rate** is **36.72%**, with **China** showing the highest rate at **37.43%**, suggesting stronger outcomes in supporting women to complete STEM degrees.

- The **Gender Gap Index** averages **0.75**, where scores closer to 1 indicate better gender parity.  
  **Australia and Germany** have the highest scores at **0.76**, showing slightly better gender balance.

- **Mathematics** has the highest number of students, followed by **Engineering**, indicating strong interest in these fields.  
  **Biology** shows moderate participation, while **Computer Science** records the lowest student count.

- **China shows an upward trend** in female enrollment, signaling continuous improvement in STEM participation.  
  Other countries have stable or slightly declining trends, showing slower growth in female representation.

- **Graduation rates increase across all countries**, suggesting that even with stable enrollment, more women successfully complete their STEM education over time.  
  This reflects improvements in academic support, access to resources, and overall success of women in STEM fields.
